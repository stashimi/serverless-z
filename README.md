Serverless is the application framework for building web, mobile and IoT applications exclusively on Amazon Web Services' Lambda and API Gateway. It's a command line interface that helps you build and maintain serverless apps across teams of any size.  It's also completely extensible via Plugins.  We believe AWS Lambda will be the focal point of the AWS cloud, and the Serverless Framework interprets AWS from Lambda's perspective.

The Framework and its related tools are maintained by a dedicated, full-time team.  For updates, join our [Mailing List](http://eepurl.com/bvz5Nj).  We work on this live in our [Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/serverless/serverless). Please join us, everyone is welcome :)

Also, we are hiring.  If you are a developer and these tools/ideologies appeal to you and you want to work on these all day long, [please send us a message](mailto:team@serverless.com).

## Getting Started

Install The Serverless Framework via npm: (requires Node V4)

```
npm install serverless -g
```

You can either install an existing project or create your own.  We recommend starting out with the [Serverless-Starter](https://www.github.com/serverless/serverless-starter)

```
serverless project install serverless-starter
```

Or you can create your own project

```
serverless project create
```

Refer to our [documentation](http://docs.serverless.com) for more info.  Enjoy!

## Contributing
We love our contributors! If you'd like to contribute to the project, feel free to submit a PR. But please keep in mind the following guidelines:

* Propose your changes before you start working on a PR. You can reach us by submitting a Github issue, or discuss it in the [Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/serverless/serverless). This is just to make sure that no one else is working on the same change, and to figure out the best way to solve the issue.
* If you're out of ideas, but still want to contribute, check out our [Road Map](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/milestones). There's a lot we want to get done, and we'd love your help!
* Contributions are not just PRs! We'd be grateful for having you in our community, and if you could provide some support for new comers, that be great! You can also do that by answering [Serverless related questions on Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/serverless-framework).
* You can also contribute by writing. Feel free to let us know if you want to publish a useful original guide in our docs (attributed to you, thank you!) that you feel will help the community.

## Release History

### 0.6.5
* Fixed a problem with loading of NPM modules as plugins in case an exception occurs

### 0.6.4
* Fixed an issue with the NPM being checked in using CRLF :roll_eyes:
* Fixed a problem with API Gateway not being able to test invoke Lambda functions using AWS_PROXY and ANY method

### 0.6.3
* Fixed deployment error on empty or invalid VPC configuration (issue #6)
* Use native AWS Lambda environment variables instead of injected ones (issue #5)

### 0.6.2
* Fixed a problem with API Gateway not being able to test invoke Lambda functions anymore

### 0.6.1
* Changed the way Serverless sets up scheduled events: Instead of creating one rule per function
  it is now possible to create a single rule that triggers up to 5 Lambdas simultaneously. Simply
  reuse the schedule name between your Lambda functions to make use of this feature.
* Due to some internal changes on how triggers are deployed, we recommend to delete your Lambda
  stages and re-deploy everything after upgrading to this version.

### 0.6.0
* Plugins are automatically loaded from `node_modules` folder. No more need to update `s-project.json`
* Support `passthroughBehavior` configuration in APIG endpoints
* Deprecated the use of `requestParameters` in APIG endpoints. Use `methodRequestParameters` and
  `integrationRequestParameters` instead. This enables support of optional request parameters and
  more flexibility in mapping integration request parameters to fixed values.
* Fixed creation of CloudWatch Events for scheduled Lambdas
* Added support for `ap-southeast-2` region
* Merged various minor bug fixes from the official Serverless repo

### 0.5.6
* Last and final official version
